I am Federico Nocentini. I am a 2nd year PhD student at the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html) at the [Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC)](https://www.micc.unifi.it/) under the supervion of [Prof. Stefano Berretti](https://www.micc.unifi.it/berretti/) and [Prof. Claudio Ferrari](https://clferrari.github.io/).

My main research interest revolve around 3D Computer Vision and Deep Learning, with a particular focus on human analysis applications, 3D and 4D generative face models.

Previously, I obtained my MSc in Computer Science and Engineering  at the University of Florence under the supervision of [Prof. Stefano Berretti](https://www.micc.unifi.it/berretti/) and [Prof. Claudio Ferrari](https://clferrari.github.io/) with a thesis titled “Generating Emotional 3D Talking Heads from Audio Spectrograms.”

_If you wish to learn more about my research or explore potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out via email!_
