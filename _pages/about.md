I am Federico Nocentini. I am a 3rd year PhD student at the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html) at the [Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC)](https://www.micc.unifi.it/) under the supervision of [Prof. Stefano Berretti](https://www.micc.unifi.it/berretti/) and [Prof. Claudio Ferrari](https://clferrari.github.io/).

I was a research scientist intern at [Flawless AI](https://www.flawlessai.com/), where I focused on multilingual speech-driven facial animation under the supervision of [Akin Caliskan](https://akincaliskan3d.github.io/).

My main research interest revolve around 3D Computer Vision and Deep Learning, with a particular focus on human analysis applications, 3D and 4D generative face models.

Previously, I obtained my MSc in Computer Science and Engineering  at the University of Florence under the supervision of [Prof. Stefano Berretti](https://www.micc.unifi.it/berretti/) and [Prof. Claudio Ferrari](https://clferrari.github.io/) with a thesis titled “Generating Emotional 3D Talking Heads from Audio Spectrograms.”
